### Trinary

Write a program that will convert a trinary number, represented as a string (e.g. '102012'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (without using an existing method or library that can work with numeral systems).

Trinary numbers can only contain three symbols: 0, 1, and 2. Invalid trinary entries should convert to decimal number 0.
